Welcome to iTrollEDU. It's a compilation of scripts that can be used to troll people.<br />
The scripts are meant to be easily copied and not require any admin permissions, so they can be quickly deployed.<br />
They should not cause any permanent damage to your computer. Even so, we are not responsible for any bad effects that may happen.<br />
Currently, we have scripts available for Mac:
<ul>
